As the first French Hyperloop technology development team based at the Institut Supérieur de l’Aéronautique et de l’Espace in Toulouse, our main goal is to design and improve the current technology and infrastructure needed to implement a Hyperloop prototype, the transport of tomorrow.

**GUI  and Control Commands**

The software will be used to build a robust graphical user interface (GUI) for the purpose of visualising the critical components of the pod’s operation. This section focuses on a general software infrastructure on which to base the Hyperloop Supaero design.

The software core sets out to fulfill the following requirements:
  
**Lightweight Communications and Marshalling (LCM)**
  * Ensure to effectively read and process information from the various sensors on-board the pod
